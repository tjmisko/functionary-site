# functionary-site

Public marketing site for **Functionary** — a project workspace for capturing
agent work and progressively formalizing recurring processes into typed,
auditable flows.

Separate from the main Functionary application repo on purpose: this is
human/design-maintained, statically built, and deployed independently to
nginx. It has no dependency on the Rust backend or the app frontend.

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) — build-time components/layouts, static HTML out.
- Scoped CSS over a vendored copy of the canvas design tokens
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`), extended in `src/styles/marketing.css`. No CSS
  framework.
- Self-hosted Inter + JetBrains Mono (a two-voice split: prose vs. machine).
- Blog posts are markdown files in `src/content/blog/`, rendered at build time;
  one RSS feed.

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for the design decisions and rationale.

npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321
npm run build      # → dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built dist/ locally
npm run check      # astro check (typecheck)
```

## Deploy

Static build → rsync to nginx on the VPS. See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

## Pre-launch

See the checklist at the end of [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md): real domain,
`og.png`, real GitHub/docs URLs, and an author pass on the seed posts.
