/**
 * Hero flow data — the single source the rotating hero renderer reads.
 *
 * Three rotating examples lead with the product's sketch → Test → formalize
 * journey and recurring information work. Additional illustrative domain
 * diagrams remain available as data, plus one hidden Office Space easter egg.
 *
 * Layout model: every node carries an explicit (col, lane). `col` (stage index)
 * → x; `lane` (vertical slot, fractional centers between lanes) → y. The
 * renderer derives geometry, `VW` from max col, `VH` from `maxLane`. Edges are
 * arbitrary from→to pairs (a node may fan out to several). `stages` is the
 * execution order: each inner array runs concurrently (`Promise.all`), stages
 * run in sequence — so ≥2 branch nodes hold RUNNING at once and the Merge node
 * waits on all upstream branches.
 *
 * Vocabulary gate (functionary-positioning-vocabulary memory): public words are
 * delegation/trust; the pain copy is insider/by-the-book voice. No banned words.
